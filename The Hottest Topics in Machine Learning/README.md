# Project: The Hottest Topics in Machine Learning

## Description
The aim of this project was to take information about the historic publication titles from the NIPS ML research conference and see if any useful insights as to the various topics
presented can be found. This could be useful in determining the future trends in applied machine learning since many cutting edge algorithmns/ topics are discussed in research before they are applied.

## Skills
In particular this project utilise the following  interesting "method (libraries)":
- Wordcloud (wordcloud): Visualising words in text data. Words with most number of occurences appear larger.
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Sklearn): Method used in NLP to determine topics in a large set of documents.
- Regular Experssions (re): Useful in pre-processing data for NLP due to flexible nature of pattern matching with strings.
